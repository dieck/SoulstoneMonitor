SoulstoneMonitor - World of Warcraft WOTLK Classic addon

## What is SoulstoneMonitor?

This small addon monitors casts in group or raid to see if a Soulstone was set.
It records which caster soulstoned which target, and how long it will be up.

It will output soulstones as text in chat window, and provides a minimap button with mouse-over list of active soulstones. (LDB compatible for e.g. TitanPanel).

## Usage

It's basically always on.
You can use /soulstonemonitor to show & hide the minimap button.
